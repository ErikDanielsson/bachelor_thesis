# Bachelor thesis
This is the repository for scripts and similar things developed during my bachelor thesis.
I am currently working on this project under the title "Efficient Bayesian inference for a host repertoire model in the probabilistic programming language TreePPL" with Mariana Pires Braga, Fredrik Ronquist and Niklas Wahlberg.

In this project I will be working on creating faster MCMC algorithms for the host repertoire model [Braga et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syaa019) in the universal probabilistic programming language [TreePPL](https://treeppl.org/).
